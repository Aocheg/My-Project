# How have you used AI for coding so far?
        I have elvolved my use of AI in my study so far. 
        Initially, I relied on AI as an answer generator due to my lack of understanding. 
        However, as I progressed and studied eachs problems my approach shifted because I begin to understand how each functions and sytax works and where to use them. 
        Hence, I use Ai as a learning tools, levraging it for guildannce and insight to help me solve problems on my own.

# Do you usually try problems yourself first?
        Yes, I try solving most of my problems myself 
        firstly, I try to understand the problems by researching online about it, steps by steps on how to solve the problems and possible ways to solve it before consulting AI for further help if i encounter a problem still did not get the full insight.

# Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help?
        Yes, I can explain most of the basic and simple code I have written without AI's heslp. I have basic understanding of how the code works, including where to place the appropriate syntax and functions to produce my desired results. This understanding allows me to confidently explain the code and make adjustments as needed to get my desired result.

# What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?
        If AI was unavailable during an exam or job test, I would have rely on my own preparation and studied materials to answer questions and complete tasks. It will be a dificult task, however, I will still approach the exam or test with confidence, drawing on my understanding of the subject matter and applying the knowledge  i acquire from studies and research to answer the questions to the dbest of my knowledge.

# dentify your current pattern:

        Learner A: uses AI as an answer generator.
        Learner B: uses AI as a learning amplifier.

        Learner B: I use AI as a learning amplifier

# Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.
        I am currently at a stage where I am gaining a foundational understanding of coding concepts and I am transitioning from relying on AI for answers to using it as a guilding tool. I am developing my problems-solving skills and building confidence in my abilities. As a learner, I aspire to become an autonomous and self-directed coder, able to tackle complex challenges with ease and continually expand my knowledge and skills. I am to eveolve into a proficient and innovative developer, capable of leveraging AI and other resources effectively to drive learning and growth.
