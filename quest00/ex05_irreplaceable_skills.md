# Lowest-rated skills: Debugging Mindset, Systems Thinking, Critical Evaluation
# 3 actions I will take this week without relying on AI:

        Debug my own code manually using print statements and test cases instead of asking AI what is wrong.

        I will draw diagrams of how functions and modules in my programs interact to improve systems thinking.

        I will review and refactor my past code to check for mistakes, inefficiencies, and better approaches.
