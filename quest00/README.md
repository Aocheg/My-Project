# Summary

    Through this project, I learned that AI is a powerful learning tool, but it should not replace my own thinking and problem-solving skills. I realized the importance of understanding concepts first before using AI for guidance, corrections, or deeper insights.

# Main Insight

    My main insight is that using AI ethically means using it to learn and improve, not to copy solutions. AI should support my reasoning, not replace it.

# Future Application

    In future quests, I will first attempt problems on my own, think through the logic, and test my understanding before asking AI for help. I will use AI to review my work, find edge cases, and deepen my knowledge while ensuring I remain the one actively solving the problem.
