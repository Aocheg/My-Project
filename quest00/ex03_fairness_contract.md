## Create a markdown file fairness_contract.md with three sections:
# I will use AI when:
        I have tried solving a problem myself for at least 15 minuts
        I want to understand why code works.
        I want to explore alternative approaches to better my understanding

# I will NOT use AI when:
        I haven't made any attempt on my own to solve the problem.
        I am taking on an exam or assessment.
        I am still learning fundamental concepts of the program.

# I know I'm using AI fairly when:
        I can explain my code very clear without AI's help.
        I could solve a related problem independntly.
        I feel more confident in my own understanding after reading AI's response.

# Sign and date your contract.
