# Interview
        
        If I have always relied on AI to design systems, I could appear unprepared or unable to justify my decisions.

# Production Bug

        At 2 AM, if AI is offline, I must rely on my own debugging skills. Without experience reading and understanding code, fixing AI-generated bugs could be impossible.

# New Technology

        If a new library is released and AI doesn’t know it, I would learn it by reading documentation, experimenting with examples, and consulting tutorials or community resources. Independent learning is key.
